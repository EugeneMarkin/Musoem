### Conducting and dj-ing

- Sequence the sections and control operations in the desired order
- Keywords for adjusting the global tempo (control)
- Keywords for adjusting the dynamics, instant and gradual changes
- Fermata?
- Schedule/apply something to the section that is already playing

### Improvising

Single pattern operations:

- reverse, transpose, retrograde, invert, shuffle, stutter selectively pitch and rhythm
- for percussive music might be good to mess around with accents
- Randomness: partial shuffle, random number of permutations, etc.

Two pattern operations:

- and

- or

- with

- but 

- is/are, etc

  What can be done? Zip them with offset, swap instruments

##### Questions:

what strategies do you suggest when composing for such a system? Music recommendations

what can be sight read?

**Interactive notation** or (live processing) or more language abstractions

what would make sense to the audience? Things

without interactive notation? text as notation

assign verbal instructions to the keywords ?

don't need to necessarily apply heavy transformations on notated sections. Could just change the dynamics and stuff
